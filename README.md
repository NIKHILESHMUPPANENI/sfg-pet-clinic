open source project used to test the Maintainablity using Software Metrices.
Maintainability defines the progression and cost associated with an entity making it the primary concern in
organisations. This report evaluates the maintainability of petshop, an open sourced cross-platform  written in java. The releases of petshop are analysed to
identify the packages difficult to maintain using a Goal Question Metric(GQM) based empirical study. The results demonstrate packages with poor maintainability 
followed by validation of the findings in comparison with maintainability index. 

Tools Used for extracting metrices are Metrics reloaded, Lizard , Jhawk etc.
